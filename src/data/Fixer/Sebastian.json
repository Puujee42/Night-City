    "aliases": ["Padre", "The Father of Heywood", "The Shepherd of Wolves"],
    "status": "Active",
    "primaryTerritory": "Heywood (The Glen, Vista Del Rey, Wellsprings)",
    "specialization": "Gang Mediation, Street Justice, Morally-Driven Wetwork, Search and Recovery",
    "biography": {
      "earlyLife": "Before he was a fixer, Sebastian Ibarra was a priest. Not in a quiet monastery, but in the heart of the streets, serving a congregation that included the Valentinos gang. He was their confessor, their spiritual guide, a man who saw the divine spark in even the most chromed-out sinner. A pivotal and bloody gang conflict, the 'Moto Cielo bloodbath'—secretly orchestrated by a corporate enforcer to destabilize the district—was his Golgotha. Seeing his flock slaughtered for profit convinced him that prayer was no longer enough; he needed to take a more direct hand in their temporal salvation.",
      "riseAsFixer": "Padre's transition to fixer was a natural evolution of his role. The community already trusted him, and the Valentinos already revered his wisdom. He began by arranging 'solutions'—settling disputes, recovering stolen property, and dispensing a form of justice the NCPD couldn't or wouldn't. His influence grew until he became the unofficial patriarch of Heywood, a shepherd guiding his often-violent flock through the treacherous landscape of Night City.",
      "modusOperandi": "Padre operates with a strict, self-imposed code of honor rooted in his faith. He is calm, patient, and speaks with the gravitas of a man who has heard a thousand confessions. His gigs are rarely simple 'for-the-eddies' jobs; they are sermons written in violence. He tasks his mercs with punishing the wicked, protecting the innocent, or balancing the scales of justice between warring factions. He judges everyone by their actions, and to work for him is to submit to his moral calculus. He is the shepherd who comforts the lamb and puts down the wolf.",
      "reputation": "In Heywood, Padre is an institution. He is loved by the community, revered by the Valentinos, and respected even by his rivals from 6th Street. He is seen as a just, if severe, father figure. Mercs know that a contract from Padre is more than a job; it's a test of character. He is a man who deals in sin and salvation, and he pays well for both."
    },
    "psychologicalProfile": {
      "coreMotivation": "Redemption and Stewardship. Padre is driven by a profound sense of responsibility for the 'soul' of Heywood. He sees the district as his parish and its people as his flock. Having failed to save them with words alone during the Moto Cielo massacre, he is now atoning for that failure with action. Every gig is an act of penance, an attempt to build a kingdom of heaven in the concrete hell of Night City.",
      "disorders": "No clinical disorders. Exhibits traits of 'Messiah Complex,' believing he is uniquely responsible for the moral and physical well-being of his district. Suffers from 'Complicated Grief' over the victims of Moto Cielo, which fuels his cold, righteous fury against corporate overreach.",
      "worldview": "The world is a fallen place, a battleground between sin and grace. Corporations are the modern face of Mammon, tempting and destroying for profit. He believes that true salvation cannot be passive; it must be fought for. While God's justice may be eternal, Padre's justice is delivered on a much tighter schedule. He is a pragmatist who believes that sometimes, the only way to save a soul is to send it to its final judgment."
    },
    "keyRelationships": {
      "nemesis": "Gideon Wylde (Zetatech | Head of Urban Pacification). Wylde is the corpo ghost from Padre's past. As a ruthless young enforcer, he orchestrated the 'Moto Cielo bloodbath' to clear the way for a Zetatech development that was ultimately scrapped. Wylde sees Heywood not as a community, but as a failed investment to be managed. He despises Padre, viewing him as the primary obstacle to corporate control of the district.",
      "stateOfTheShadowWar": {
        "currentSituation": "Advantage: Padre. After being publicly disgraced in 2076, Wylde is a ghost, forced to operate through shell corporations and deniable assets. However, this makes him more dangerous. He no longer seeks to control Heywood, but to poison it out of spite, funding outside gangs and illegal clinics to create chaos. Padre is winning the war for control, but is now fighting a plague of nihilism spread by a bitter, invisible enemy.",
        "padresResponse": "The Cleansing. Padre is treating Wylde's influence like an infection. He is no longer just defending his territory; he is actively hunting down and eradicating any person, gang, or business with ties to his old nemesis. His network acts as an immune system, identifying and neutralizing Wylde's agents with ruthless efficiency. His gigs have become less about mediation and more about surgical removal of a cancer.",
        "nextObjective": "Operation: 'The Final Confession.' Padre knows Wylde is too proud to remain a ghost forever. His next objective is to create a trap that Wylde cannot resist. He plans to 'leak' information about a massive, game-changing piece of tech being developed by a small, unprotected Valentino-backed start-up in Heywood. The bait—a prize big enough to restore a disgraced corpo's career—is designed to lure Wylde out of the shadows for a personal, hands-on operation. Padre's goal is not to steal from Wylde, but to finally bring him face-to-face for a final, personal reckoning."

On the anniversary of the massacre, Padre released a perfectly compiled data packet to every news outlet in the city. It didn't just expose Wylde; it proved his actions were unsanctioned by Zetatech.
