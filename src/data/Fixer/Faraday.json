    "image": "/friday.png",
    "aliases": ["The Militech Leash", "The Asset Burner", "The Kingmaker"],
    "status": "Deceased (2076)",
    "primaryTerritory": "Santo Domingo, Corpo Plaza",
    "specialization": "Corporate Espionage, Prototype Acquisition, Black Ops, Asset Denial",
    "biography": {
      "earlyLife": "Faraday wasn't born into the corporate elite; he was a gutter rat who clawed his way into a Militech internship. Surrounded by old-money executives who saw him as disposable, he developed a pathological ambition fueled by a deep-seated fear of being sent back to the streets. He saw the corporate ladder not as a path, but as a bloody cage match. His 'talent' was recognizing that the mercs of Night City were just like him—desperate, hungry, and willing to burn brightly if it meant escaping the gutter, making them the perfect fuel for his own ascent.",
      "riseAsFixer": "Faraday was never a true fixer; he was a lab rat with a corporate expense account. He was put in charge of Militech's unofficial 'Asset-Driven R&D'—a deniable black-ops division designed to field-test experimental tech by giving it to mercenary crews and pointing them at Arasaka. He didn't build a network; he curated a stable of disposable assets. He became known as the man who could give you tomorrow's chrome today, for a price that was rarely paid in just eddies.",
      "modusOperandi": "Faraday was a master of weaponized ambition. He didn't just offer gigs; he offered a taste of the life he craved—power, respect, and bleeding-edge chrome. He saw his crews as scalpels: incredibly sharp, effective, and meant to be discarded after one use. He was a meticulous planner on paper but had zero understanding of human limits, viewing cyberpsychosis not as a tragedy, but as a failed experiment. His primary directive was always to ensure that when an asset burned out, his own fingerprints were nowhere on the ashes.",
      "reputation": "In the Afterlife, Faraday's name is a ghost story told to chrome-happy rookies. He is the ultimate example of a corpo leash that strangles you the moment you stop pulling. He didn't just use crews; he consumed them, burning through Maine's legendary team and David Martinez's potential to power his own meteoric, and ultimately fatal, rise. Working for Faraday was a deal with the devil where the fine print was written in your own blood."
    },
    "psychologicalProfile": {
      "coreMotivation": "Fear of Irrelevance. Faraday's ambition wasn't for power itself, but to build a wall of success and status so high it would forever separate him from the poverty of his youth. Every promotion was another brick in the wall. He was terrified of being seen as the street kid he once was, leading him to take increasingly reckless risks to prove his worth in the corporate world.",
      "disorders": "Malignant Narcissism, Severe Inferiority Complex (masked by grandiosity), Antisocial Personality Disorder. He lacked empathy, viewing people as tools. His entire self-worth was tied to external validation (promotions, successful operations), making him pathologically incapable of accepting failure.",
      "worldview": "The world is a hierarchy of predators and prey. He believed he was a predator who had earned his place, and mercs were a lower form of predator to be used and discarded. He saw loyalty as a weakness and sentiment as a fatal flaw. The only things that mattered were results and plausible deniability."
    },
    "keyRelationships": {
      "nemesis": "Director Whitley (Militech | Head of Official Acquisitions). Whitley is everything Faraday is not: old-money, cautious, and a believer in 'proper channels.' Faraday's career was built on the ashes of Whitley's failures, a fact Whitley never forgot. After being publicly humiliated by Faraday in the 'Grand Prix Gambit,' Whitley ceased to be a simple rival and became a predator waiting in the long grass, using bureaucracy and corporate procedure as his weapons.",
      "stateOfTheShadowWar": {
        "currentSituation": "Advantage: Whitley (Pre-Mortem). Whitley was winning by playing the long game. He used his influence to subtly deny Faraday's crews support, red-flag his budgets, and leak anonymous tips to Arasaka about 'rogue Militech assets.' He was building a case, patiently waiting for Faraday's recklessness to create a big enough mess for him to step in, clean up, and claim the ultimate prize.",
        "faradaysResponse": "Aggressive Escalation. Faraday knew he couldn't win a political battle against Whitley. His only move was to generate results so spectacular and profitable that the board would have to overlook his methods. This forced him to push his assets (Maine, then David) to their absolute limits, using more unstable prototypes and taking on increasingly suicidal missions. He was trying to outrun the consequences.",
        "nextObjective": "Operation: 'Kingmaker.' The Cyberskeleton gig was Faraday's endgame. His objective was not just to strike Arasaka, but to create a 'shock and awe' event that would be so undeniably successful it would force the Militech board to promote him over Whitley. He was betting everything on one final, desperate roll of the dice, using David Martinez as his chip."
      }
    },
    "legendaryArsenal": {
      "rumor": "Faraday didn't just provide gear; he provided unstable, bleeding-edge prototypes directly from Militech's black labs. To be equipped by Faraday was to become a field test for weapons and chrome that could win a war or tear you apart from the inside. The price for this power was being the guinea pig.",
      "weapons": [
        {
          "name": "The Haywire Cannon",
          "description": "The prototype vehicle-mounted EMP cannon used in 'The Grand Prix Gambit.' It was a divisional-level weapon that Faraday 'lost' in the paperwork and diverted to Maine's crew. Its unstable power core was known to cause massive collateral damage, a feature Faraday saw as a bonus for creating media-worthy chaos."
        },
        {
          "name": "The 'Berserker' Protocol",
          "description": "A series of unregistered, combat-stimulant injectors and a Sandevistan accelerator designed to be paired. It pushed a user's chrome to its absolute redline, offering god-like speed and strength at the cost of massive neural strain and accelerated cyberpsychosis. Faraday gave this to Maine, viewing his eventual breakdown as 'valuable performance data.'"

      "overview": "Faraday had no friends or partners, only a curated portfolio of 'assets.' These were the mercenary crews he identified as having the perfect blend of high ambition and low self-preservation. He invested in them, chromed them up, and burned them for fuel. To be chosen by Faraday was to be marked for a spectacular, but brief, career.",

          "profile": "A powerful solo who led a legendary crew. Maine was Faraday's proof of concept—a merc ambitious enough to take on any risk for a taste of the major leagues. He was the perfect asset: effective, loyal (at first), and willing to chrome up past the point of no return.",
          "relationship": "Faraday saw Maine as his prize bull, a tool to be honed and aimed. He fed Maine's ego and his hunger for chrome, creating a dependent relationship. For Maine, Faraday was the ticket to the top; he was tragically unaware he was just the first stage of the rocket.",
          "roleInTheShadowWar": "Maine's success in the 'Grand Prix Gambit' and other early gigs is what put Faraday on the map and truly ignited the war with Whitley. His eventual death from cyberpsychosis provided Faraday with the 'data' he needed to justify the next, more extreme project: the Cyberskeleton."

          "profile": "A kid from the gutter with an impossible tolerance for cyberware. Faraday saw David not as a person, but as the perfect vessel for his ultimate weapon, the Cyberskeleton. David's desperation to prove himself and his unique biology made him, in Faraday's eyes, the key to his final victory.",
          "relationship": "Purely predatory. Faraday groomed David, manipulating his grief and his ambitions, promising him the world while seeing him as a disposable component. He was the scientist, and David was the experiment he was willing to push until it exploded.",
          "roleInTheShadowWar": "David was the weapon Faraday intended to use to destroy Whitley's career. The 'Final Ascent' was meant to be his crowning achievement. Instead, David's uncontrollable rampage became the very disaster Whitley was waiting for, giving him the ammunition to have Faraday permanently 'downsized.'"

Faraday didn't just deliver the Kestrel; he proved his high-risk methods were more effective. He got the promotion; Whitley got a formal reprimand and a burning hatred.",

They eliminated Faraday to erase their connection to the disaster he orchestrated.",

It gave his rival, Whitley, all the ammunition he needed to have Faraday erased from Militech's books permanently. The gig that was meant to make him a king instead made him a ghost."
