    "title": "Muamar 'El Capitán' Reyes",
    "image": "/choom.png",
    "aliases": ["El Capitán", "The Captain", "King of the Concrete Jungle"],
    "status": "Active",
    "primaryTerritory": "Santo Domingo (Arroyo, Rancho Coronado)",
    "specialization": "Vehicle Acquisition & Theft, Corporate Sabotage, Street Justice, Smuggling",
    "biography": {
      "earlyLife": "Muamar Reyes wasn't born into power; he earned it with grease on his hands and corporate dust on his lungs. He started as a logistics specialist for a mid-level corporation, a corpo rat stuck in the endless grind of Santo Domingo's industrial sector. He saw firsthand how the corps squeezed every last drop of life from the district and its people. Deciding he'd rather be the one doing the squeezing, he quit, cashed in his pension, and used his insider knowledge of shipping routes and corporate security to start his own, far more profitable, 'logistics' business.",
      "riseAsFixer": "He adopted the moniker 'El Capitán' and quickly became the go-to fixer for Santo Domingo. His edge was his unique blend of corpo professionalism and street-level empathy. He understood the language of the boardroom and the struggles of the factory worker. He built a reputation as a fair, if demanding, boss who ruled from the driver's seat of his armored limo. He is a self-made king with a network of spies in every garage and warehouse in the district he calls home.",
      "modusOperandi": "El Capitán's true passion is horsepower. Any gig involving rare, fast, or armored vehicles will immediately get his attention. His primary business is a high-end vehicle acquisition service, but he also handles a wide range of jobs, from sabotaging rival corporate facilities to dispensing vigilante justice on gangs that prey on the locals. He's pragmatic and business-minded, but he has a fierce, paternal loyalty to Santo Domingo and will often commission gigs that, while profitable, also serve to protect his community.",
      "reputation": "In Santo Domingo, El Capitán's authority is absolute. The NCPD turns a blind eye, and the corps pay him for 'security consulting' that's little more than protection money. To mercs, he is a top-tier employer: demanding, but fair. He provides solid intel, pays what he promises, and values results above all. He's a man who respects hard work and horsepower, and if you can deliver both, you'll always have a place on his payroll."
    },
    "psychologicalProfile": {
      "coreMotivation": "Sovereignty and Protection. Having escaped the corporate machine, El Capitán is driven to maintain his self-made kingdom of Santo Domingo as a bastion against the very exploitation he suffered. He is fiercely protective of his territory and its people. His rivalry with Welles is not just about personal pride; it's a war to prove that the will of the street will always triumph over corporate control.",
      "disorders": "None diagnosed. Exhibits traits of 'Benevolent Warlord' syndrome—a paternalistic and controlling demeanor driven by a genuine desire to protect his chosen community. Possesses a mild obsession with high-performance vehicles, viewing them as symbols of freedom and power.",
      "worldview": "The world is divided into two groups: those who build and those who take. He was a builder who got taken from, so he became the most efficient taker of all. He believes in earned respect, tangible results, and the simple justice of the street. A contract is a promise, and a promise is sacred. A fast car is not a luxury; it's an escape hatch."
    },
    "keyRelationships": {
      "nemesis": "Gideon Welles (Director of R&D, Archer). Welles was Muamar's tyrannical former boss, a man who believed workers were disposable parts in a machine. After El Capitán humiliated him in 'The Great Concession Heist,' Welles was fired. He resurfaced years later at Archer, where his department now develops the most advanced anti-theft and convoy security systems in the world. Their rivalry is a high-speed chess match played across the highways of Night City.",
      "stateOfTheShadowWar": {
        "currentSituation": "Advantage: Welles. Welles' new 'Cerberus' anti-hijacking AI and his advanced security convoys are making El Capitán's work harder and more expensive. Archer vehicles are becoming the gold standard in security, and Welles is using this technological superiority to slowly choke El Capitán's operational freedom. Every new successful convoy is a win for Welles' logic over El Capitán's grit.",
        "reyesResponse": "Asymmetrical Warfare. El Capitán knows he can't out-tech Welles. Instead, he's doubling down on his greatest asset: the streets. He is using his vast network of local informants to find weaknesses in Welles' logistics—human error, maintenance schedules, driver routines. He is fighting an AI with an army of people, proving that no code can account for the unpredictability of the human element.",
        "nextObjective": "Operation: 'Ghost in the Machine.' El Capitán's next move is to steal not just a vehicle, but the very key to Welles' kingdom. His objective is to acquire the master source code for the next iteration of the 'Cerberus' AI. The plan is to orchestrate a multi-stage heist that forces Welles to transport the master shard via a decoy, low-security convoy. El Capitán will sacrifice several of his own crews in loud, failed attacks on the high-security convoys to build Welles' confidence, before using his top operative, 'La Fantasma,' to silently lift the real prize from the one vehicle Welles thinks is safe."

He is said to loan it only to 'La Fantasma' for jobs where failure is not an option."

It's a Militech-grade vehicle interface spike that can physically bypass most electronic locks and ignition systems by creating a hardwired bridge. It's an ugly, brutal solution for a digital problem, embodying El Capitán's pragmatic philosophy. It's his go-to tool for cracking Welles' Archer security."

He analyzes the data from every failed and successful heist against Archer vehicles, reverse-engineering Welles' tech and finding the cracks in his armor.
