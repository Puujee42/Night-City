      "nemesis": "Commander 'Stonewall' Jackson (Militech | Heavy Infantry Division). Jackson is a heavily augmented Militech cyborg and the sole survivor of the 'Labyrinth' incident. He and his entire elite squad were systematically dismantled in a sealed bunker by a single operative with 'The Corner-Cutter,' without ever seeing the attacker. The humiliation shattered his career. He is now obsessed with finding the weapon, viewing it as a perversion of honorable combat and a ghost from his past that must be exorcised.",

    "legendaryOrigin": {
        "gigTitle": "The Labyrinth Heist",
        "date": "08.22.2074",
        "objective": "A legendary corporate spy known only as 'The Ghost' was hired to retrieve sensitive data from a secure Militech bunker defended by Commander Jackson's elite 'Stonewall' squad.",
        "client": "Arthur 'The Architect' Cormac",
        "target": "Militech 'Project Chimera' Deployment Roster",
        "outcome": "A legendary display of indirect warfare. 'The Ghost,' armed with the sole Seeker prototype, never entered a single room. Using the bunker's ventilation shafts and service corridors, they fired ricocheting tracer darts to tag the guards. They then used the weapon's homing bullets to eliminate the entire squad from impossible angles, firing through vents and around corners. Jackson was the last one left, trapped in a room with the screams of his men on the comms, unable to find an enemy to shoot back at. 'The Ghost' retrieved the data and vanished, leaving a traumatized and humiliated commander in their wake.",
        "mercFate": "'The Ghost' became an almost mythical figure in the world of corporate espionage, their reputation for impossible infiltrations cemented by this single, audacious gig. The Corner-Cutter became their calling card.",
        "mercFeedback": "'The security footage is useless. It just shows Jackson's squad getting picked apart by bullets coming from nowhere. The ballistics report is a joke; trajectories are impossible. It's not a firefight; it's a geometry problem from hell. The target wasn't a man; he was a ghost with a trick gun.' - Militech Internal Affairs report.",
        "payout": "A priceless piece of Militech intelligence.",
        "reputationImpact": "This event turned 'The Corner-Cutter' into a legend, the ultimate tool for a thinking person's firefight. It proved that in the dense urban jungle of Night City, the deadliest angle is the one you can't see. It also created a bitter and obsessed enemy in Commander Jackson, a man who now hunts the weapon that made him a laughingstock."

    "designAndMaterials": {
        "materials": "The frame of 'The Corner-Cutter' is a lightweight magnesium alloy, designed for speed and handling. The internal components are master-crafted, featuring a more powerful magnetic-pulse generator for the tracer darts and a refined projectile magnetization system. The grip is custom-molded and contains an integrated micro-gyroscope that assists with calculating ricochet angles.",
        "ammunitionType": "Uses a proprietary 'Seeker' flechette round. The prototype version used by 'The Ghost' is lighter and faster, allowing for more aggressive ricochets. The tracer dart is also a custom model with a more powerful adhesive and a longer-lasting pulse.",
        "compatibleMods": [
            { "slot": "Optics", "mod": "Ghost's Eye Kiroshi", "description": "A custom-calibrated Kiroshi optic that directly interfaces with the weapon's trajectory software, highlighting potential ricochet paths in real-time." },
            { "slot": "Internal", "mod": "The 'Trick Shot' Gyro", "description": "This unique, prototype gyroscope is the heart of the weapon. It provides enhanced ricochet calculation, allowing the tracer dart itself to bounce once before tagging a target." }

     "weaponPhilosophy": {
      "concept": "The Seeker was designed to rewrite the rules of urban combat. Its philosophy is that cover is not a defense; it is a puzzle to be solved. It rejects the idea of direct confrontation in favor of superior angles and tactical creativity. The weapon forces its user to see the battlefield not as a flat plane, but as a three-dimensional geometric space filled with possibilities. It is a tool for the artist of the ricochet, the merc who understands that the deadliest shot is the one that never travels in a straight line."

    "manufacturingIntel": {
      "creatorReputation": "Tsunami is known for reliable, if uninspired, firearms. 'The Corner-Cutter' was the prototype for their most innovative design, a project led by a former NCPD SWAT officer who was tired of losing squad members to enemies hunkered down behind impossible cover.",
      "developmentHistory": "After 'The Ghost' used the prototype to publicly humiliate Militech, Tsunami, fearing a lawsuit, officially 'canceled' the project. They then released a less powerful, commercially available 'Seeker' with a weaker tagging system and no ricochet capability for the tracer dart. 'The Corner-Cutter' is the one-of-a-kind original, a weapon that Tsunami officially denies ever existed.",

    "tacticalAssessment": {
      "strengths": [
        "Unparalleled ability to eliminate enemies behind cover without exposing the user.",
        "The ricocheting tracer dart allows for tagging targets that are themselves in cover.",
        "The armor penetration on crits makes it surprisingly effective against armored targets.",
        "Rewards creative thinking and a deep, tactical understanding of the environment."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Requires a two-step process to use effectively, making it slower in a direct firefight.",
        "The homing projectiles can be unreliable in wide-open areas with no surfaces to ricochet from.",
        "Lower base damage per shot compared to a heavy revolver or tech rifle.",
        "Possession of this weapon makes you the personal target of the disgraced Militech cyborg, Commander 'Stonewall' Jackson."
      ],
      "recommendedRoles": "Tactical Solo, Combat Techie, Urban Combat Specialist, Infiltrator.",
      "masteryArchetype": "A 'Bank Shot' build. A merc with a high Intelligence and Cool attribute who excels at battlefield geometry. The ideal user combines 'The Corner-Cutter' with a Ping quickhack or a high-end Kiroshi optic to see enemies through walls. They don't engage in direct firefights; they win them from the safety of another room, peppering a tagged target with a volley of impossible, ricocheting shots."

      "marketAvailability": "Unique. This weapon is a stolen prototype and a piece of corporate ghost-lore. It cannot be bought.",
      "rumoredLocation": "After 'The Labyrinth Heist,' the weapon's creator, 'The Ghost,' vanished. Its current location is a high-value secret. Some whisper that 'The Ghost' was an alias for a legendary netrunner who has since retired, hiding the gun in a digital dead-drop for a worthy successor. Others claim it was traded to Mr. Hands as payment for a new identity. The only certainty is that Militech and Commander Jackson have a standing, seven-figure bounty for any information leading to its recovery."

    "crewSynergyAssessment": {
        "analysis": "The Corner-Cutter is the ultimate tool for a crew's tactician or combat techie. Its user is not the primary damage dealer, but the problem solver. Their role is to use the weapon's unique properties to dismantle heavily fortified enemy positions that the rest of the crew cannot safely approach. It synergizes perfectly with a netrunner using 'Ping' to reveal enemy locations, and a heavy-hitter or solo who can provide cover fire and deal with any enemies that rush the Corner-Cutter's position. Its purpose is to turn an impossible defensive stronghold into a deathtrap for its own defenders."
