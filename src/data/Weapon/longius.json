      "creator": "Lin Junjie (Kang Tao Ballistics Division)",
      "creatorReputation": "Lin Junjie is a 'brute-force' theorist, a direct rival to the elegant, stealth-focused engineers at Arasaka. He believes that no problem exists that cannot be solved with a sufficiently large application of kinetic energy. His designs are infamous for their massive power consumption, deafening sound profiles, and unparalleled destructive capability.",
      "developmentHistory": "The Longinus was Kang Tao's answer to the heavily armored 'Behemoth'-class cyborgs deployed by Militech during the Fourth Corporate War. The primary innovation is the 'Magnetic Final Stage Acceleration' (MFSA) system. The molten tungsten spike is fired conventionally, but a series of magnetic coils along the barrel accelerate it further *after* it has already left, ensuring maximum velocity at extreme ranges. The project was deemed too power-intensive and slow for standard infantry, relegating it to a highly specialized, anti-materiel role. Only a handful of prototypes were ever field-tested.",

    "tacticalAssessment": {
      "strengths": [
        "Unrivaled single-shot damage, capable of one-shotting most targets.",
        "A fully charged shot ignores all armor, making it the ultimate tank-killer.",
        "Exceptional performance at extreme ranges, with damage increasing over distance.",
        "Devastating against vehicles, mechs, and heavily armored cyborgs."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cannot be silenced, making it a 'one shot, one alert' weapon.",
        "Extremely slow rate of fire and a lengthy reload leave the user vulnerable.",
        "The charge time makes hitting fast-moving targets incredibly difficult.",
        "Unique ammunition is nearly impossible to find on the open market."
      ],
      "recommendedRoles": "Anti-Materiel Sniper, Designated Marksman, Heavy Asset Neutralizer.",
      "masteryArchetype": "A 'Patient Hunter' build. A solo with a high Cool attribute who finds a perch and waits for the perfect shot. They don't engage in firefights; they end them before they begin. Cyberware that enhances optical zoom, stability, and battlefield awareness is essential to unlock its true, city-block-spanning potential."

      "marketAvailability": "Effectively zero. The Longinus is a state secret. It cannot be bought. It can only be 'acquired' as the ultimate reward from a legendary fixer for an impossible job, or pried from the hands of a Kang Tao black ops commander.",
      "rumoredLocation": "Intel suggests a Kang Tao convoy transporting a Longinus prototype was ambushed by Wraiths in the eastern Badlands. The Wraiths, lacking the skill to use it, are rumored to be keeping the weapon as a trophy in their main fortress, the 'Sun-Scorched Overlook,' under the personal guard of their leader."
