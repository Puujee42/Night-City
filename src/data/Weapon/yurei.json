    "cost": "â‚¬$145,000 (Black Market Estimate)",
    "specialAbility": "Fires cryogenic rounds that slow enemies and can flash-freeze them solid on a critical hit. The weapon is completely silent, registering no higher on audio sensors than a whisper.",

    "designAndMaterials": {
      "materials": "The Yurei's chassis is constructed from a lightweight, non-RF reflective polymer composite, making it difficult to detect with thermal or radar scans. The core components and barrel are milled from a titanium-tungsten alloy for durability and thermal regulation. The grip is lined with a bio-synthetic material that adapts to the user's hand for superior handling.",
      "ammunitionType": "Utilizes a proprietary 7mm Cryo-Shard Caseless round. Each projectile consists of a fin-stabilized, armor-piercing flechette suspended in a supercooled liquid nitrogen solution. Upon firing, a magnetic coil propels the flechette while the solution is released as a rapidly expanding aerosol, which creates the freezing effect and acts as a natural sound dampener. This system eliminates both gunpowder and a traditional firing pin, resulting in total silence.",

    "weaponPhilosophy": {
      "concept": "The Yurei was not designed as a weapon of war, but as an instrument of control. Its philosophy is rooted in the Arasaka principle of 'perfect execution.' A traditional firearm announces its presence with sound and fury, admitting a loss of control. The Yurei, by contrast, removes threats from the equation without a whisper. It turns a chaotic firefight into a silent, methodical problem-solving exercise. The goal is not just to neutralize the target, but to do so in a way that leaves the enemy confused and terrified, fighting ghosts in a suddenly frozen room. It is the physical embodiment of fear, silence, and surgical lethality."

    "manufacturingIntel": {
      "creator": "Dr. Kenji Tanaka",
      "creatorReputation": "Dr. Tanaka is a legendary but reclusive weapons engineer in Arasaka's Advanced R&D wing, known for his obsession with 'elegant lethality.' He views traditional firearms as crude and noisy. His projects focus on silent, exotic energy types and neuro-linked smart-targeting. He is a perfectionist who rarely allows his prototypes to leave the lab, making any Yurei found in the wild an object of immense value and corporate interest.",
      "developmentHistory": "The 'Yurei' (Japanese for 'Ghost') was developed under Project Chimera as a next-generation tool for Arasaka's most elite corporate infiltrators and assassins. The goal was to create a weapon that could neutralize a squad of heavily augmented guards in a sealed room without alerting anyone on the other side of the door. The cryogenic delivery system was a breakthrough, serving as both a disabling agent and a sound dampener. The project was officially 'shelved' after Dr. Tanaka deemed the power cell unstable, but rumors persist that a handful of working prototypes were stolen by a Netrunner during a security breach.",
      "productionDate": "Circa 2075-2076"

    "tacticalAssessment": {
      "strengths": [
        "Completely silent operation allows for full-auto combat in stealth scenarios.",
        "Cryogenic rounds provide exceptional crowd control, slowing multiple targets.",
        "Devastating against enemies vulnerable to Cold or those with overheating cyberware.",
        "Smart-targeting ensures high accuracy even in chaotic situations."

      "weaknesses": [
        "Lower base damage compared to traditional Power SMGs.",
        "Ineffective against heavily armored or robotic enemies resistant to Cold.",
        "The cryogenic ammunition is extremely rare and expensive to acquire.",
        "Possession of this weapon will make you a high-priority target for Arasaka recovery teams."

      "recommendedRoles": "Netrunner-Solo Hybrid, Stealth Assassin, Corporate Infiltrator.",
      "masteryArchetype": "A 'Ghost' or 'Shinobi' build. An operative who combines netrunning skills (for distraction and stealth daemons) with a Sandevistan or Kerenzikov for rapid, silent takedowns. The weapon's true potential is unlocked by a user who can chain critical hits to keep entire squads frozen and helpless."

    "acquisitionIntel": {
      "marketAvailability": "Extremely Rare. The Yurei is not sold on any legitimate market. It can only be acquired through specific, high-level black market auctions, as a reward from a top-tier fixer like Rogue, or by looting it from an Arasaka black ops agent who was very, very unlucky.",
      "rumoredLocation": "Whispers on the net suggest a netrunner known as 'Cipher' fenced a stolen prototype to the Voodoo Boys, who may be holding it in a secure server room deep within their Pacifica territory. Another rumor places one in the private collection of a reclusive North Oak celebrity."

A patrol got the drop on me while I was jacked in, and I thought the op was blown. But there was no gunfire to alert the QRF. Just a soft *hiss* and two statues where the guards used to be. I finished the hack without my solo even knowing I was in trouble. It's the ultimate 'plan B' for any serious 'runner.'",

It's like trying to stop a charging rhino with an ice cube. The slow-down is cute, but it doesn't have the stopping power for a straight-up firefight against chromed-out gangoons. I'll stick to my Carnage, thanks. This is for spies and assassins, not soldiers.'",

    "crewSynergyAssessment": {
      "analysis": "The Yurei is a force multiplier for any crew that prioritizes stealth and control over brute force. It is the perfect weapon for the crew's Infiltrator or Netrunner, allowing them to neutralize threats without compromising the team's position. For a solo acting as the point man, it allows for the silent removal of entire patrols, clearing a path for the rest of the crew to achieve their objectives. However, its effectiveness plummets in open combat. A successful crew will pair the Yurei's user with a heavy-hitter (a Street Samurai or Techie with heavy weapons) who can take over if and when stealth is broken. Its role is to ensure the fight never has to happen in the first place."
