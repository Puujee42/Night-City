      "creator": "Darra Polytechnic (Artisan Division)",
      "creatorReputation": "Darra Polytechnic is known for producing reliable, no-frills firearms. The 'Widowmaker' line was an experimental passion project, an attempt to fuse classic, handcrafted shotgun design with modern tech weaponry. They wanted to create a gun for the discerning merc who appreciates the feel of polished wood and engraved steel but demands the performance of a cutting-edge railgun.",
      "developmentHistory": "The design is based on a classic over-under shotgun, prized for its balance and reliability. The innovation came from replacing the standard firing mechanism with a compact, electromagnetic charging system. This allows the user to fire standard shells or to hold the trigger, charging both barrels to launch the projectiles at hypersonic speeds. The result is a weapon that functions as a reliable CQC tool and a devastating, short-range anti-cover weapon. It became a cult favorite among tech-savvy solos and collectors.",

    "tacticalAssessment": {
      "strengths": [
        "Extremely versatile; functions as both a standard Power shotgun and a cover-penetrating Tech weapon.",
        "The charged shot is capable of eliminating multiple, tightly-packed enemies through thin walls.",
        "High burst damage makes it devastating in close-quarters ambushes.",
        "Faster reload speed than most pump-action or drum-fed shotguns."
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Limited to two shots before a mandatory reload, punishing missed shots.",
        "The charged shot has a significant delay, requiring a pre-calculated attack.",
        "The wider spread on the charged shot makes it less effective against single targets at medium range.",
        "Loud and flashy, making it unsuitable for stealth."
      ],
      "recommendedRoles": "Techie-Solo Hybrid, Breacher, Combat Engineer.",
      "masteryArchetype": "A 'Combat Tactician' build. A merc with a high Technical Ability attribute who uses their knowledge of the environment to their advantage. The ideal user doesn't charge into a room; they ping their enemies, see them through the walls, and use the Widowmaker's charged shot to eliminate them before the fight even begins. They are a master of ambush and surprise."

      "marketAvailability": "Rare, but obtainable. The Widowmaker is a high-end, specialist weapon. It can be found at upscale weapon vendors in City Center and Japantown. It is also a known favorite of combat-oriented Nomads, and can sometimes be purchased from their traveling caravans.",
      "rumoredLocation": "Nash, a high-ranking member of the Raffen Shiv, is said to carry a heavily modified Widowmaker with a custom stock and an overclocked charging coil. He was last seen running a smuggling operation out of a cave system in the eastern Badlands."
